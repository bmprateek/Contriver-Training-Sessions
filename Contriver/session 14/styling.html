            Getting the message across – in style. That’s what typography is all about. It greatly affects the mood of the reader. 
            Like when you’re reading a manuscript, most of the time, its on a yellow (ocher)-ish background. When you’re reading 
            stuff related to food, you’re going to find a lot of red color use. That’s because the color read triggers the brain 
            cells that relate to food. For example, Burger King, KFC, McDonald’s – they all have the color red in common.
